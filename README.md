data structres as arrays,strings,linked lists,stacks,queues,trees,graphs and hashtables
basic algorithms :
sorting as bubble sort ,merge sort and quicksort

###############################################
you can clone the repo and run the project for each question 
the questions exist in the python file also with commit at the begining each file git 
his name by the number of the question and number of section 
each file has a main to run the code with some examples 
question number 10 is not acode its analyzations for time and space complexity
